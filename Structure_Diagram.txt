Bitmap Interpreter:
- Interpret Images
    - Save Encrypted (Hex + encrypted or just hex) binary file
        - Create File Extension
            - ?????


    - Read binary file
        - Read number of bits relating to colour depth
            - Decrypt Run length encoding
            - New Line if PIXELS % WIDTH = 0 

        - Interpret Colour
            - Read bits for R, G and B
                - Convert Binary to Decimal
            - Assign RGB value based on read bits
                - Minimum of 3 bits for R G and B values else just black and white (grey if 2 bits, take average)
                - Divide RGB Spectrum into parts based on Colour depth


    - Convert Image to Bitmap
        - Divide Image into reasonbly big chunks
            - Find average colour of chunks


    - Output Image
